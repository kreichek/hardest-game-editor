This is my Fundamentals of Programming (15-112 - Fall 2013) term project at Carnegie Mellon University. It is a re-creation of the popular flash game "The World's Hardest Game." In addition to a fully functional game, it includes a level editor that can be used to create a large variety of different levels to play. Detailed instructions on how to actually use the program can be found under Instructions in the main menu of the program.

To run the project, compile the file “hardest-game-editor.py” (Python 2.7).

The only dependency to run the game is pygame, which is a Python module that can be downloaded here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.

A demonstration of the project can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ocHqYg7qM
